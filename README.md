# keyboard-speech-bubbles-26

## Speech bubbles 26
Speech bubbles is a 24+2 (12 finger keys and a single thumb key on each side) keyboard. It has space for a quite big thumb key to allow for a constant natural hit on the key.

## Hand size with picture
Every custom keyboard is designed with certain hand specs in mind. I have rather small hands and my index finger is retatively short compared to my middle finger. I also have pinly issues that I struggle with and then finally my inner most thumb joint cannot bend. Every design aspect in this board has taken these specs into account.

## Learnings
- Trrs requires a thin neck (blunter from my side, next board should have more spacing)
- All three printable parts need a brim (at least on my printer prusa mk4) to work. This means a little border remains even after the brim is removed.
- My next board will have a pcb (I hope) unless it will be something keywell

## Special thanks
I have used way more time experimenting with different keycounts, designs and layouts than I thought I needed to before settling with this. During this I got so much help online from so many people that I can't even remember all of them (sorry).  

A special thanks to Wimads from the Bastardkb and Fingerpunch discord servers. Half of all the tricks I use regularly in onshape is because Wimads took his time (hours and hours) learning me the ins and outs in onshape. He also keeps commenting and giving new angles on design and ideas in general.

Another special thanks to Burfkers. Burfkers is to printers and electronics, what wimads is to onshape; a wizard with an eager to help people online. I also had some qmk challengeds that Bufkers helped sort our (dont run you qmk with sudo in general).

When it comes to encouragement to decrease the number of keys in my layout, reeve_. (repo: ), casuanoob (repo: ) and apfel (repo: ) has been of great inspiration and part of the reason I kept trying out new combos until I could actually use them.

A thankyou also goes to all the nice people who gave valuable input on the fingerpunch server during the entire development: reeve_, quappo, mayday, bravekarma, damselfly, Yingeling, saixos and rafaelromao are some of them.

I general, Quentin from bastardbk.com and sadekbaroudi from fingerpunch.xyz who both have each their discord server. These two servers are the most beginner friendly environments and the people in there have a very high average level of expertise in every area I have yet come across in this regard.
